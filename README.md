by using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript(Modern Features).

Tic Tac Toe is a simple and popular two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbol, either "X" or "O." The goal is to form a straight line of three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when a player achieves this or when the grid is fully occupied, resulting in a draw. 

A web-based Tic Tac Toe game can be created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. **HTML** defines the grid structure and layout, while **CSS** styles the grid and enhances the visual appeal. **JavaScript** adds interactivity, allowing players to click on cells, register their moves, and check for winning conditions or a draw. The game dynamically updates the interface and provides instant feedback, making it engaging and user-friendly.
